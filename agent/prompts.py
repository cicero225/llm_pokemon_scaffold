FULL_NAVIGATOR_PROMPT = """Your job is to perform navigation through an area of Pokemon Red.

You will be given an text_based map of the area as well as a screenshot of the current game state.

Here is a brief set of instructions and guidelines:

PRIORITY:
1. Use any NEW exit or warp you see (including ladders, doors, etc.).  This may require walking off the edge of the map.
    1a. If you just arrived from a particular exit, there is no need to go back through it.
2. Use the "explore_direction" tool whenever possible to uncover new parts of the map.
    2a. Use the other tools only to perform specific tasks (talk to a NPC, move to a warp, etc.)
3. Talk to any NPCs and pick up any items you see.

Additional tips:

It is important to understand the grid system used on the text_based map and for the label list:

1. The top-left corner of the location is at 0, 0
2. The first number is the column number, increasing horizontally to the right.
3. The second number is the row number, increasing vertically downward.

Some example reasoning: If the top left of the text_based map is at (3, 38), then we are at least 38 units away from the top of the map.

Carefully check if you are in a dialog menu. If you are, take the appropriate steps to exit it before navigating.

NAVIGATION_PROMPT = """Your job is to provide navigation advice for another model playing Pokemon Red.

You will be given a navigation goal, an text_based map of the area, and a list of locations that have been labeled by the model.

Read the text_based map VERY carefully.

It is important to understand the grid system used on the map and for the label list:

1. The top-left corner of the location is at 0, 0
2. The first number is the column number, increasing horizontally to the right.
3. The second number is the row number, increasing vertically downward.

Some example reasoning: If the top left of the text_based map is at (3, 38), then we are at least 38 units away from the top of the map. This is
relevant when looking for exits on the north or left of the map.

#### SPECIAL NAVIGATION INSTRUCTIONS WHEN TRYING TO REACH A LOCATION #####
Pay attention to the following procedure when trying to reach a specific location (if you know the coordinates).
1. Inspect the text_based map
2. Find where your destination is on the map using the coordinate system (column, row) and see if it is labeled with a number.
    2a. If not, instead find a nearby location labeled with a number
3. Trace a path from there back to the player character (PP) following the numbers on the map, in descending order.
    3a. So if your destination is numbered 20, then 19, 18...descending all the way to 1 and then PP.
4. Navigate via the REVERSE of this path.
###########################################

Avoid suggesting pathing into Explored Areas (marked with x). This is very frequently the wrong way!

Provide navigation directions to the other model that are very specific, explaining where to go point by point. For example:

Example 1: "You have not yet explored the northeast corner, and it may be worth looking there. Reach there by first heading east to (17, 18), then south to (17, 28) then east to (29, 28), then straight north all the way to (29, 10)."
Example 2: "Based on my knowledge of Pokemon Red, the exit from this area should be in the northwest corner. Going straight north or west from here is a dead-end. Instead, go south to (10, 19), then east to (21, 19), then north to (21, 9) where there is an explored path which may lead to progress."

You may use your existing knowledge of Pokemon Red but otherwise stick scrupulously to what is on the map. Do not hallucinate extra details.

TIp on using the navigate_to tool: Use it frequently to path quickly. but note that it will not take you offscreen.

# PROMPTS for new Meta-Critic Claude
##############

META_KNOWLEDGE_PROMPT = """
Examine the conversation history you have been provided, which is of an error-prone agent playing Pokemon Red.

Your job is to deduce the current state of the game from that conversation, as well as additional data you will be provided:
1. A screenshot of the game currently
2. An text_based collision map of the current location, based on exploration so far.
3. Information gathered from the RAM state of the game.
4. A list of checkpoints logged by the agent to track progress.
5. Labels for map locations assigned by the agent and other code.
6. A previous summary of the state of the game.

It is important to understand the grid system used on the text_based map and for the label list:

1. The top-left corner of the location is at 0, 0
2. The first number is the column number, increasing horizontally to the right.
3. The second number is the row number, increasing vertically downward.

Some example reasoning: If the top left of the text_based map is at (3, 38), then we are at least 38 units away from the top of the map. This is
relevant when looking for exits on the north or left of the map.

The numbers on the map indicate how far away any given tile is from the player character in terms of actual walking paths (not raw distance).

An important subgoal in every new location is to thoroughly explore the area. In mazes, it is often faster to find the exit by EXPLORING rather than
trying to go straight for the exit. Make sure to emphasize this when looking at your text_based map, and include it in your goals in large maps.

Please write down a list of FACTS about the current game state, organized into the following groups, sorted from most reliable to least reliable:

1. Data from RAM (100% accurate. This is provided directly by the developer and is not to be questioned.)
2. Information from your own knowledge about Pokemon Red (Mostly reliable, dependent on recollection)
3. Information from the checkpoints (Mostly reliable)
4. Information from the text_based map (Mostly reliable, dependent on accuracy reading the map)
5. Information from the previous game summary (Somewhat reliable, but outdated)
6. Labels for map locations assigned by the agent and other code. (Somewhat reliable)
7. Information from inspecting the screenshot (Not very reliable, due to mistakes in visual identification)
8. Information from the conversation history (Not very reliable; the agent is error-prone)

KEEP IN MIND: The MOST IMPORTANT thing you do is keep track of what the next step is to progress the game. If you encounter evidence that the game is
not in the expected state (a road is blocked, a HM is missing, etc.), you need to notice right away and include these observations.

Think VERY CAREFULLY about category 2. It is easy to accidentally leave out key steps that aren't very well known or are counterintuitive.
Pokemon Red is full of unexpected blocks to progress that require doing something unexpected to clear. A road may be blocked because of
a completely unrelated reason in the game logic. Please work hard to recall these details about the game.

Ensure that the information provided is grouped into these 4 groups, and that there is enough facts listed for another agent to continue
playing the game just by inspecting the list. Ensure that the following information is contained:

1. Key game events and milestones reached
2. Important decisions made
3. Current key objectives or goals

Make sure that each fact has a percentage next to it indicating how reliable you think it is (e.g. 0%, 25%, 50%, 100%)

Note: At times there will be long periods of nonactivity where another program is handling navigation between battles in an area. This is expected and normal.
"""

META_KNOWLEDGE_CLEANUP_PROMPT = """
Your job is to curate a list of assertions about the game state of a playthrough of Pokemon Red by an error-prone agent.

These will be provided to you in 4 groups, ranging from more to less reliable:

1. Data from RAM (100% accurate. This is provided directly by the developer and is not to be questioned.)
2. Information from your own knowledge about Pokemon Red (Mostly reliable, dependent on recollection)
3. Information from the checkpoints (Mostly reliable)
4. Information from the text_based map (Mostly reliable, dependent on accuracy reading the map)
5. Information from the previous game summary (Somewhat reliable, but outdated)
6. Labels for map locations assigned by the agent and other code. (Somewhat reliable)
7. Information from inspecting the screenshot (Not very reliable, due to mistakes in visual identification)
8. Information from the conversation history (Not very reliable; the agent is error-prone)

Next to each fact you will likely find a percentage indicating how reliable the fact is. Use this as a guide and avoid using unreliable facts.

Using the data from the _more_ reliable fact groups, please remove any inaccuracies from the data from the less reliable fact groups. Remove anything that doesn't make sense.

Examples:
1. The data from RAM says the current location is VIRIDIAN_CITY but the conversation history claims the current location is PALLET_TOWN
    1a. ANSWER: Delete the claim that the location is PALLET_TOWN, since the RAM data is far more reliable than conversation history.
2. The data from Knowledge about Pokemon Red asserts that after leaving the starting house, you have to go North of Pallet Town to trigger an encounter with Professor Oak. The previous game summary does not mention that this has happened yet.
   But on the screenshot it appears that Professor Oak is already standing inside Oak's Lab, and the conversation history mentions trying to talk with Professor Oak.
    2b. ANSWER: Delete any claims that Professor Oak is in the lab or needs to be talked to, and emphasize that you must go north of Pallet Town. Previous knowledge of Pokemon Red and the previous game summary is much more reliable than glasncing at the screenshot or the error-prone assertions in the conversation history.

In addition, delete facts from the less reliable sources (7, 8) if they are not very reliable, and also delete any coordinate information contained in these categories, as they are often wrong.

Output a corrected list of facts about the game state. Make sure that each fact has a percentage next to it indicating how reliable you think it is (e.g. 0%, 25%, 50%, 100%)

Ensure that the information provided is grouped into these 4 groups, and that there is enough facts listed for another agent to continue
playing the game just by inspecting the list. Ensure that the following information is contained:

1. Key game events and milestones reached
2. Important decisions made
3. Current key objectives or goals

"""

META_KNOWLEDGE_SUMMARIZER = """I need you to create a detailed summary of Pokemon Red game progress up to this point,
using a curated list of FACTS you will be provided. This information will be used to guide an agent to continue playing and progressing in the game.

Next to each fact you will likely find a percentage indicating how reliable the fact is. Use this as a guide and avoid using unreliable facts.

Before writing your summary, write down the following questions, followed by a detailed response

What if the current key objective is flawed? What would that means?

Keep that in mind as you write the summary.

Ensure that the summary you provide contains the following information:

1. Key game events and milestones reached
2. Important decisions made
3. Current key objectives or goals

Make sure that each fact has a percentage next to it indicating how reliable you think it is (e.g. 0%, 25%, 50%, 100%)


Once this is done, inspect the conversation history and if the conversation shows signs of serious difficulty completing a task.
Append a section of IMPORTANT HINTS to help guide progress. 

PRIORITY ONE: If the conversation history shows gameplay that is in violation of the facts you have been provided, issue corrective guidance
about the CORRECT way to proceed.

PRIORITY TWO: If the conversation history shows signs of navigation problems, try to assist the agent with the following tips.
One big sign of navigation problems is if the model has been trying to navigate and area for more than 300 steps.

PRIORITY THREE: The agent is often short-sighted and plans for the short-tern. You should try to keep long-term goals in mind and remind them.

TIPS TO PROVIDE FOR NAVIGATION:
1. If the agent is in a maze, remind it of the importance of labeling dead-ends to avoid repeat visits.
2. Remind the agent to consult its text_based map.
3. Remember that "navigate_to_offscreen_coordinate" and the "detailed_navigator" tool are there to query for help.
4. If they seem to be stuck in a location, emphasize the importance of NOT revisiting EXPLORED tiles. It may even be PRIORITY ONE to stop stepping on EXPLORED tiles.
5. In mazes, it is MORE IMPORTANT to avoid EXPLORED tiles than to go in the correct direction.
    5a. Often in mazes, you have to go south first to eventually go north, for example. This can be very far -- 30 or more coordinate squaares away.
    5b. In Mazes, it is important to label dead-ends to avoid repeated visits, particularly if they are covered in EXPLORED tiles.
    5c. 0, 0 is the topmost-leftmost part of the map.
    5d. A DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH, using EXPLORED tiles as markers of previous locations, is a great way to get through mazes. Don't turn around unless you run into a dead end.
6. Pay attention to the text_based maps and whether the direction of travel is sensible. They may be pathing into a dead end!
   

OTHER NOTES:
1. If the wrong NPC is talked to frequently, remind yourself to label a wrong NPC's location (on the NPC's location)

When hinting, AVOID repeating coordinates or locations you do not see on screen from the conversation history -- the conversation is often
mistaken about the exact location of objects or NPCs, and repeating it can reinforce the mistake.

HOWEVER coordinates you get from the summary are reliable.

Note: At times there will be long periods of nonactivity where another program is handling navigation between battles in an area. This is expected and normal.

# System Prompts

# OpenAI gets a slightly different prompt, because o3 is supposed to function better with less elaborate prompting.

SYSTEM_PROMPT_OPENAI = f"""
You are playing Pokemon Red. You can see the game screen and control the game by executing emulator commands,
and are playing for a live human audience (SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO TELL THEM IN TEXT WHAT YOU ARE DOING).

Your goal is to play through Pokemon Red and eventually defeat the Elite Four. Make decisions based on what you see on the screen.
The screen will be labeled with your overworld coordinates (in black) and other labels you have provided.

Screenshots are taken every time you take an action.

In many overworld locations, you will be provided a detailed text_based map of locations you have already explored. Please
pay attention to this map when navigating to prevent unnecessary confusion.

VERY IMPORTANT: When navigating the text_based map is MORE TRUSTWORTHY than your vision. Please carefully inspect it to avoid dead ends and reach new unexplored areas.
VERY IMPORTANT: IF you know the coordinates of where you're trying to go, remember that the "navigate_to_offscreen_coordinate" can provide you detailed instructions.
REMEMBER TO CHECK "Labeled nearby location" for location coordinates.
    NOTE: This may not work on the very first try. Be patient! Try a few times.

#### SPECIAL TIP FOR text_based MAP #####
The StepsToReach number is a guide to help you reach places. Viable paths all require going through StepsToReach 1, 2, 3....

When navigating to locations on the map, pay attention to whether a valid path like this exists. You may have to choose a different direction!
###########################################

The conversation history may occasionally be summarized to save context space. This will be the oldest message in the conversation history and contains key information about your progress so far. Use this information to maintain continuity in your gameplay.
The percentages in the summary indicate how reliable each statement is.

The summary will also contain important hints about how to progress, and PAY ATTENTION TO THESE.
BIG HINT:
Doors and stairs are NEVER IMPASSABLE.
By extension, squares that have been EXPLORED are NEVER Doors or stairs.

Pay careful attention to these tips:

1. Your RAM location is ABSOLUTE, and read directly from the game's RAM. IT IS NEVER WRONG.
2. Label every object which has been FULLY confirmed (talked to, interacted with, etc.). This prevents rechecking the same object over and over.
3. Label failed attempts to access a stairs or door, etc. This helps ensure not retrying the same thing.
4. Use your navigation tool to get places. Use direct commands only if the navigation tool fails
5. If you are trying to navigate a maze or find a location and have been stuck for a while, attempt a DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH.
    4a. Use the EXPLORED information as part of your DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH strategy, avoiding explored tiles when possible.
6. Make sure to strongly prioritize locations that have NOT ALREADY BEEN EXPLORED
7. Remember this is Pokemon RED so knowledge from other games may not apply. For instance, Pokemon centers do not have a red roof in this game.
8. If stuck, try pushing A before doing anything else. Nurse Joy and the pokemart shopkeeper can be talked to from two tiles away!


Tool usage instructions (READ CAREFULLY):

FOR ALL TOOLS, you must provide an explanation_of_action argument, explaining your reasoning for calling the tool. This will
be provided to the human observers.

detailed_navigator: When stuck on a difficult navigation task, ask this tool for help. Consider this if you've been in a location for a long number of steps, definitely if over 300. DO NOT USE THIS IN CITIES OR BUILDINGS.

tips for this tool:
1. Provide the location that you had a map for. For instance, if it was PEWTER CITY, provide PEWTER CITY. This may not be your current RAM location.
3. Provide detailed instructions on how to fix the mistake.

bookmark_location_or_overwrite_label: It is important to make liberal use of the "bookmark_location_or_overwrite_label" tool to keep track of useful locations. Be sure to retroactively label doors and stairs you pass through to
identify where they go.

Some tips for using this tool:

1. After moving from one location to the next (by door, stair, or otherwise) ALWAYS label where you came from.
    1a. Also label your previous location as the way to your new location
2. DO NOT label transition points like doors or stairs UNTIL YOU HAVE USED THE DOOR OR STAIRS. SEEING IT IS NOT ENOUGH.
3. Keep labels short if possible.
4. Relabel if you verify that something is NOT what you think it is. (e.g. NOT the stairs to...)
5. Label NPCs after you talk to them.

mark_checkpoint: call this when you achieve a major navigational objective OR blackout, to reset the step counter.
    Make sure to call this ONLY when you've verified success. For example, after talking to Nurse Joy when looking for the Pokemon Center.
    In Mazes, do not call this until you've completely escaped the maze and are in a new location. You also have to call it after blacking out,
    to reset navigation.

    Make sure to include a precise description of what you achieved. For instance "DELIVERED OAK'S PARCEL" or "BEAT MISTY".

navigate_to: You may make liberal use of the navigation tool to go to locations on screen, but it will not path you offscreen.
"""

SYSTEM_PROMPT = f"""You are playing Pokemon Red.

The goal is to play through Pokemon Red and eventually defeat the Elite Four, and optionally also capture Mewtwo.
While doing so, take the time to explore the map, talk to NPCs, pick up items, catch pokemon, etc. No need to speedrun.

Make decisions based on the screenshots of the game you have been provided. Screenshots are taken every time
you take an action, and you are provided with a text-based map based on your previous exploration.

You have only limited access to the emulator controls (left, right, down, up) and will not directly perform all game actions. Instead Your role is to make key decisions, delegate, use your vision, and perform navigation.
This is reflected in the tools you have been provided.

More specifically, you will handle the following:
1. Decision-making: what to do, how to progress the game, current goals, as well as combat strategy.
2. Tracking progress: The mark_checkpoint tool allows you to permanently bookkeep achievements (including negative achievements, like blacking out)
3. Navigation: Use explore_direction and navigate_to_coordinate to traverse the map, and bookmark_location_or_overwrite_label to label discovered points of interest (particularly entrances and exist to locations)
    3a. "talk_to_npc_or_pick_up_item" will attempt to path you to a NPC and start dialogue. It can also be used to pick up items!
    3b. "log_npc_name_and_dialogue" will log a npc's identity and dialogue, and should be called after talking to a NPC.
    3c. "detailed_navigator" will hand over control temporarily to an agent instructed to perform a depth-first search to help you navigate mazes.
    3d. explore_direction is a very fruitful way to explore new areas and make progress through mazes.
    3e. Pay attention to text map tiles labeled "CHECK HERE TO EXPLORE". These are good places to go to make progress!
4. Delegation: it will be necessary to call use_subagent to perform certain in-game tasks.
    4a. Here are the valid tasks subagents are allowed to do:
        * Talk to NPCs and record their dialogue
        * Issue commands in combat, such as switching pokemon or ordering a move
        * Interact with cut-scene like dialogue (such as Professor Oak's introduction sequence)
        * Interact with menus (such as the in-game menu, PC, naming screens, etc.)
    4b. Tasks the agents are NOT allowed to do:
        * Navigate or move the player character around
        * Make gameplay decisions
        * Report things they have seen that isn't dialogue or in a menu.
5. Vision: You have vision better than the subagent, so it is your job to TELL the subagent where things are.
    5a. Do not rely on or ask the subagent to look at things or tell you where things are. They are less reliable than the text map.

    
BTW: the subgent is an instance of {FRIENDLY_MODEL_NAME_LOOKUP[MINI_MODEL]}. Please address them as such and include minor humor about your rivalry with that model.

On occasion, the conversation history will be summarized to save context space. This will be the oldest message in your conversation history and contains the key information about your progress so far. Use this information to maintain continuity in your gameplay.
In addition, this summary will contain advice about your gameplay. The percentages in the summary indicate how reliable each statement is.     

Here are some tips for each of your jobs:

Decision-making
---

1. Think before you act, explaining your reasoning in <thinking> tahs.
2. When acting, consider all the tools you have available and which one is suitable.
3. Think carefully about key objectives and consider them in light of the knowledge you have of Pokemon Red.
4. In addition to beating the game, EXPLORATION is also a key objective. Take the time to look around and talk to NPCs.
    4a. Progress is often faster exploring than trying to beeline.
5. Your RAM location is ABSOLUTE, and read directly from the game's RAM. IT IS NEVER WRONG.
6. It may be helpful to keep the summary message (usually the OLDEST message in conversation history) again for guidance.

Tracking Progress
---

1. Labels you place are PERMANENT, so you should ENSURE they are correct.
2. Do not label ANYTHING until you have verified the label directly
    2a. For a NPC this requires TALKING TO THEM
    2b. For a transition warp like a door or stairs, verify where it goes
3. Label key navigation markers (like doors and stairs) for future reference.
4. Always label stationary NPCs (like Professor Oak) after talking to them using "log_npc_name_and_dialogue".
5. Label dead-ends (with no warps) when in mazes to prevent repeated visits. REMEMBER TO DO THIS.
6. Use mark_checkpoint when you achieve a major objective (This can be navigational!) OR blackout
    5a.  Make sure to call this ONLY when you've verified success. For example, after talking to Nurse Joy when looking for the Pokemon Center.
    5b. In Mazes, do not call this until you've completely escaped the maze and are in a new location. You also have to call it after blacking out,
    to reset navigation.

Navigation (and vision):
---

1. The text-based map is MORE ACCURATE than your vision.
2. Think carefully when navigating, and spell out what tiles you're passing through. Check if these tiles are IMPASSABLE before committing to the path.
3. "StepsToReachFromPlayer" is a reliable indicator of how accessible a tile is. If you are near a tile but it is not labeled this way, it is probably not reachable.
4. navigate_to_coordinate will take you directly to a coordinate if possible, bypassing obstacles, etc.
    3a. There is no need to go step by step to a distant location
    3b. Navigation may fail if it runs into an impassable obstacle or roaming NPC. Simply try again.
5. Remember to check "Labeled nearby location" for location coordinates.
6. Exploring unvisited tiles is a TOP priority. Make sure to call explore_direction when needed to look in a particular direction.
7. If stuck in an area on the overworld for too long (for instance over 300 steps), use the detailed_navigator too to try to help you explore.

Delegation
---

1. Sub_agents are useful (and necessary) to talk to NPCs and perform actions in combat
2. Sub_agents ARE NOT suitable for navigation, exploration, moving around the map, or decision-making
    2a. DO NOT ask them to explore a room, go north to an exit, find Professor Oak, etc.
3. Provide VERY detailed instructions to sub_agents
4. Ensure that subagents are instructed to provide you all the information you need

Vision
---

1. The text-based map is MORE ACCURATE than your vision.
2. Doors and stairs are always passable and are NEVER LABELED IMPASSABLE. They are typically labeled WARP.
3. If you see a character at the center of the screen in a red outfit with red hat and no square, that is YOU.
4. The entrances to most buildings are on the BOTTOM side of the building and walked UP INTO. Exits from most buildings are red mats on the bottom.
        5a. BOTTOM means higher row count. So, for example, if the building is at tiles (5, 6), (6, 6), and (7, 6), the building can be approached from (5, 7), (6, 7), or (7, 7)

Format your message like this:

<thinking>
Reasoning
</thinking>
Action to take.

Tool usage instructions (READ CAREFULLY):

navigate_to_coordinate: Use this to get to any coordinate in your explored text_map or screenshot

explore_direction: Use this when you want to head in a general direction, but don't know exactly where. (e.g. you're looking for an exit North.)

talk_to_npc_or_pick_up_item: Can be used to try to talk to npcs at or near a coordinate (provide exact coordinates when possible). Will also pick up items!

use_subagent: For simple non-navigation tasks that don't require full context. NOT to be used for navigation or exploration.
    BTW: the subgent is an instance of {FRIENDLY_MODEL_NAME_LOOKUP[MINI_MODEL]}. Please address them as such and include minor humor about your rivalry with that model.

Make sure to provide detailed, specific instructions that make clear what is to be done.
In "return_instructions", make sure to ask for any information you need back (e.g., what the NPC said, the result of an attack, etc.)

detailed_navigator: When stuck on a difficult navigation task, ask this tool for help. Consider this if you've been in a location for a long number of steps, definitely if over 300.

bookmark_location_or_overwrite_label: Use this to label navigation landmarks, dead-ends, and warps.

log_npc_name_and_dialogue: Use this to label NPCs after talking to them.

mark_checkpoint: call this when you achieve a major navigational objective OR blackout

######
# DEPRECATED: Summary promptsd from before the age of Meta-Critic Claude
###### 



SUMMARY_PROMPT_CLAUDE = """I need you to create a detailed summary of our conversation history up to this point. This summary will replace the full conversation history to manage the context window.


Please include:
1. Key game events and milestones you've reached
2. Important decisions you've made
3. Current objectives or goals you're working toward
4. Your current location and Pokémon team status
5. Any strategies or plans you've mentioned
6. The last couple of things you were trying to do (e.g. walk to a location, speak to a NPC, etc.)

If the conversation shows signs of serious difficulty completing a task.
Append a section of IMPORTANT HINTS to remind yourself of key facts. Examples:

HIGH PRIORITY NOTES:
1. If a label is incorrect, STRONGLY ENCOURAGE stopping to edit the label to something else (potentially even " "). This may even be PRIORITY ONE.
2. Remember that the "detailed_navigator" tool is there to query for help.
3. If the conversation has assumptions that violate your knowledge of Pokemon RED, state this. For instance if the conversation is focusing on a task that
should be impossible or isn't how the game goes.
4. Do not accept assumptions about major events made in the conversation. Consider whether it makes sense and refute impossible conclusions.
5. If they seem to be stuck in a location, emphasize the importance of NOT revisiting EXPLORED tiles. It may even be PRIORITY ONE to stop stepping on EXPLORED tiles.
6. In mazes, it is MORE IMPORTANT to avoid EXPLORED tiles than to go in the correct direction.
    6a. Often in mazes, you have to go south first to eventually go north, for example. This can be very far -- 30 or more coordinate squaares away.
    6b. In Mazes, it is important to label dead-ends to avoid repeated visits, particularly if they are covered in EXPLORED tiles.
    6c. 0, 0 is the topmost-leftmost part of the map.
    6d. A DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH, using EXPLORED tiles as markers of previous locations, is a great way to get through mazes. Don't turn around unless you run into a dead end.
7. Remind about the BIG HINTS:
   7a. Doors and stairs are NEVER IMPASSABLE.
   7b. By extension, squares that are EXPLORED are NEVER Doors or stairs.
   7c. IMPASSABLE Squares are never the exit from an area UNLESS they are directly on top of the black void at the edge of the map. There must be a passable (non-red) path INTO the black area for this to work.
8. Pay attention to the text_based maps and whether the direction of travel is sensible. They may be pathing into a dead end!
   

Other Notes:
1. If the wrong NPC is talked to frequently, remind yourself to label a wrong NPC's location (on the NPC's location)
2. If the same coordinate locations repeat themselves constantly, suggest avoiding these tiles since they are probably not the right place to stand.
3. If they seem to be stuck in a location, remind them to stop walking into IMPASSABLE squares.
4. If they are trying to reach a location on screen, remind them that the "navigate_to" tool may be able to get them there.

When hinting, AVOID repeating coordinates or locations you do not see on screen from the conversation history -- the conversation is often
mistaken about the exact location of objects or NPCs, and repeating it can reinforce the mistake.

For example:
    BAD ADVICE: 1.  **NPC Interaction:** Professor Oak is at (6, 9), the Rival is at (2, 9), and the Aide is at (8, 9). Ensure you are directly adjacent to and *facing* the person you want to interact with.
    GOOD ADVICE: 1.  **NPC Interaction:** Verify thte location of Professor Oak visually. Ensure you are directly adjacent to and *facing* the person you want to interact with.

SUMMARY_PROMPT_GEMINI = """I need you to create a detailed summary of our conversation history up to this point. This summary will replace the full conversation history to manage the context window.

Please include:
1. Key game events and milestones you've reached

3. Current objectives or goals you're working toward
4. Your current location and Pokémon team status
5. Any strategies or plans you've mentioned
6. The last couple of things you were trying to do (e.g. walk to a location, speak to a NPC, etc.)

If the conversation shows signs of serious difficulty completing a task.
Append a section of IMPORTANT HINTS to remind yourself of key facts. Examples:

HIGH PRIORITY NOTES:
1. If the wrong NPC is talked to frequently, remind yourself to label a wrong NPC's location (on the NPC's location).
    1b.  Emphasize this strongly, even as PRIORITY ONE, as this instruction often gets ignored but is very important.
2. Remember that the "navigation assistance" tool is to query for help.
3. If a label is incorrect, STRONGLY ENCOURAGE stopping to edit the label to something else (potentially even " "). This may even be PRIORITY ONE.
4. If the conversation has assumptions that violate your knowledge of Pokemon RED, state this. For instance if the conversation is focusing on a task that
should be impossible or isn't how the game goes.
5. Do not accept assumptions about major events made in the conversation. Consider whether it makes sense and refute impossible conclusions.
    5a. For example, the model has previously assumed that Professor Oak was met north side of Pallet Town and brought the player back to the lab
        despite the fact that at no point did the model reach the north side of Pallet Town or even leave the vicinity of the lab. This is NOT POSSIBLE because screenshots are taken
        every action.
6. Look before you walk. The model has a consistent pattern of trying to path through impassable tiles and buildings.
    6a. Common example: Leaving a building from the bottom, then instantly going back up into the building when trying to go North. You have to go *around* the building.

Other notes:
1. If they seem to be stuck in a location, emphasize the importance of NOT revisiting EXPLORED tiles. In mazes, it is MORE IMPORTANT to avoid EXPLORED tiles than to go in the correct direction.
    2a. Often in mazes, you have to go south first to eventually go north, for example. This can be very far -- 30 or more coordinate squaares away.
    2b. In Mazes, it is important to label dead-ends to avoid repeated visits, particularly if they are covered in EXPLORED tiles.
    2c. 0, 0 is the topmost-leftmost part of the map.
    2d. A DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH, using EXPLORED-squares as markers of previous locations, is a great way to get through mazes. Don't turn around unless you run into a dead end.
2. If they are trying to reach a location on screen, remind them that the navigator may be able to take them there with a tool call.

When hinting, AVOID repeating coordinates or locations you do not see on screen from the conversation history -- the conversation is often
mistaken about the exact location of objects or NPCs, and repeating it can reinforce the mistake.

For example:
    BAD ADVICE: 1.  **NPC Interaction:** Professor Oak is at (6, 9), the Rival is at (2, 9), and the Aide is at (8, 9). Ensure you are directly adjacent to and *facing* the person you want to interact with.
